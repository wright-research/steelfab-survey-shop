I’m learning because he understands I’m not perfect, even though I’m a perfectionist. I just want to make sure my team does their jobs safely and efficiently, and to their satisfaction. He sees that. ",People & Culture,"There seems to be an atmosphere where decision-making may be influenced by close family relationships within management, which can sometimes create the perception that personal loyalty outweighs fairness or merit. This can make some employees hesitant to share concerns or ideas openly. In addition, when critical errors occur, it can feel as though they’re quietly managed rather than discussed openly to help the whole team learn and prevent future issues. Together, these factors may contribute to a reduced sense of confidence in leadership among some staff.",People & Culture,Extremely satisfied,100,"I want yo see more training for mid and upper management. Floor employees are trained on-the-job, as they should be. But other key concerns are those who operate specialty equipment like programming, the Dragon A-400, and the Peddibot-1100. Those people need certified training to operate those machines efficiently and properly. I truly believe that this would enhance efficiency and production by reducing errors.     Another concern is the quality of the equipment. Many welding machines are old. Their voltage and wire speed regulators are strained and consistent welds are often elusive. Many machines appear to be patched together and their full potential is not realized. ",Training & Career Development

Middle management can’t seem to create a reasonable schedule.  One day we can work 8-10 hours, then the next, everything is a rush and have to work 10-12 hours plus a Saturday; however, the rules don’t apply to all sides of the street. Both shops are not created equally!",Management & Leadership,Dissatisfied,40,Treat people like family as the company  promotes.  Currently it feels like I work for Brooklyn Iron.  Upper management needs to be more involved with certain people in middle  management and HR.  The company is big enough to have someone in HR with a degree and can actually answer questions instead of just saying “I don’t know” or “let me make a call”  Certain things have happened with individuals that need to be looked into.  Moral is so low and only getting worse!  ,Leadership Improvement
